## Why jQuery?

As a Full Stack Web Developer, I have been using the Angular framework in the last 5 years. This year I started studying the React framework, which is very requested in job offers. These frameworks are very good, but they don't compare to jQuery in terms of market share: 77.4% of all websites on the Internet use jQuery (October, 2022). My decision for using jQuery was based on the large number of developers who are not yet familiar with these new frameworks.

## How To Include New Country

It is very difficult to design a political spectrum test with generic questions for all countries. Often the ideology of one wing of the political spectrum only applies to a particular country. The Political GPS test considers that the questions to identify a person's ideology should be based on the context in which he lives. To design a political test for your country, you can copy this entire repository and build another website, with your questions in context. Eventually I will use subdomains like "br.existo.me" to distinguish between countries. In this case, I'll just redirect the domain "www.existo.me" to your site using your country's code as a subdomain.


## What If I Don't Program

If this sounds like *gibberish* to you, no worries, just send me an e-mail: **united.sapiens.br@gmail.com**. You can send me your idea and/or content and I'll see what I can do.
